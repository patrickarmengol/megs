# megs (Missing Essential Go Structures)

A collection of useful Go data structures.

## Motivation

Working through some leetcode and advent of code problems, I often ran into the need to re-implement certain data structures.

Existing solutions were not using generics (like [emirpasic/gods](https://github.com/emirpasic/gods)), were for only a single data structure (like [hashicorp/go-set](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/hashicorp/go-set)), and/or had strange or lackluster implementations.

Go seems to be holding back on implementing generic data structures into the language / standard library until they are more sure about _how_ they should be implemented.

Writing these myself is meant to serve as a quick refresher and reference on data structures, but hopefully I can also import this code into other projects.
